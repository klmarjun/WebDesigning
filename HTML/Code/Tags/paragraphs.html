            paragraph always starts on a new line
        </p>
        <p>
            This is another paragraph
            It contains multiple lines
            But the browser fails to display it
            The browser displays everything in the same line without a line break
            The number of lines in a paragraph 
            depends on the size of the browser 
            window. If you resize the browser 
            window, the number of lines in this 
            paragraph will change.
